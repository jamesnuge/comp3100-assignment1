\section*{Introduction}
The first assignment for COMP3100 involves creating a scheduler to operate in tandem with the ds-sim server application.
The scheduler would assign jobs using a naive `round robin' algorithm, only allocating to the servers within the largest type as defined by the number of cores each server has.
The purpose of the assignment was to introduce students to some concepts in distributed systems such as job scheduling, as well as some core java programming concepts such as socket programming.
